# Simple Jekyll

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a powerful tool for building static sites.  Combined with some basic GitHub knowledge and some exposure to web hosting concepts, anyone should be able to create beautiful and extensible static sites quickly and cheaply.

**Simple Jekyll**'s vision is to be a launchpad for your first Jekyll-built website.  We'll walk you through your early work with Jekyll with simple to understand tutorials and guides.  After that, we hope to set you up with some clear next steps to take your understanding and portfolio to the next level.

The rest is up to you.
